  <p>This is a solo test for creating a GIThub repository and pushing changes to it. I used "git init" in the cshell on test-site2 folder to create the repository, and then I  opened the file location in VS Code.</p>
  <p>I created two additional folders; images and scripts.</p>
  <p>Next, I will add all the changes and commit them to the repository with comment.</p>
  <p>All seems successful. I will save changes then add and commit this paragraph, and then push to the repository.</p>
